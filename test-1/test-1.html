  <h1>Which is better, ice cream or cake?</h1>
    <h4>Ice cream is obviously better than cake.</h4>
    <p>Ice cream is definitely better than cake! I think ice cream is better because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's cold and refreshing</li>
      <li>It comes in a bunch of great flavors</li>
      <li>It doesn't get stale</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, ice cream is great because:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can buy it easily from any store</li>
      <li>You can put toppings on it</li>
    </ol>
    <!--Needed both a html base and end tags to all tags. Very important to make sure you close your code before the next line if its not 
      gonna continue, like in nav you may want li inside the nav element.Then you make sure that the nav elements tag ends after you have what you want inside
    the nav element. This is just a example on what to do to make sure it looks nice and clean-->
